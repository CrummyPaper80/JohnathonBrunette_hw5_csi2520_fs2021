        <p>Hello, my name is Johnathon Brunette and I am from Grand Rapids, MI. I love golf and bowling and marching band. I love music and gaming. 
        I am currently employed at the SECS helpdesk and I had an internship at my high school where I was part of the tech department there.
        I want to eventually make my way into some kind of Information Technology whether that be a system admin or some other thing like it.
        If you want to know more about me check out my Resume and Fun Facts pages.
        </p>
